<b><u>The Device Setup Dialog</b></u>
<p>

<b><u>OS Type</b></u><br>
Choose the operating system your Kodi runs on. The default is Android. Changing the operating system also changes the file path to Kodi's data folder to the default for the chosen OS.
<p>
<b><u>Description</b></u><br>
Enter a descriptive title for your device.
<p>
<b><u>Address (Android only)</b></u><br>
Enter the device IP address. A device name is also allowable
if you have set it up with your router.
<p>

<b><u>Package name (Android only)</b></u>, default: org.xbmc.kodi. <br>
Select the package name by choosing your media center software from the Media Center presets, or enter package name directly. If you are running Kodi leave this setting unchanged.
<p>
<b><u>File Path</b></u><br>
This is the location of Kodi's data on your device. This location varies depending on the OS Kodi is running on and can be entered in different ways:
<p>
Change the Kodi OS to select a default value per OS<br>
<p>
Select a Media Center preset (Android only)<br>
Available presets:<br>
Kodi<br>
SPMC<br>
Other<br>
<p>
File Path button<br>
Browse the adbLink filesystem to locate your file path, useful if Kodi's data is in a non-standard location (e.g. a network share).
<p>
Manually enter
<p>
<b><u>Pull Folder (Android only)</b></u>, default: User's home directory.<br>
Choose the folder where pulled Kodi files and screenshot pngs are placed.
<p>
The <b>Check for updates at startup</b> checkbox causes adbLink to check jocala.com for updates at startup. This is on by default.
<p>
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adbfire.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
