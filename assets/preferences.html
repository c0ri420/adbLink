<p>

Adding a device record with adbLink
<p>
Records are added in two ways: Pressing the "New" button or
double-clicking an USB serial number in the "Android Devices"
box.
<p>
Pressing "New" brings up an empty record screen. Double-clicking a
USB serial number does the same but fills in pertinent USB data
for the new record.
<p>
Entering data:
<p>
Start with a completely blank record screen, by pressing "New".
<p>
Record data fields:
<p>
Choose Kodi OS. The default is android.  However you can choose Windows, macOS or Linux
as well, depending on what build of Kodi you're working with.
<p>
Description:
A description for the device, e.g. Livingroom TV. A description must be unique. You couldn't have
two devices named "Livingroom TV".
<p>
Address. The address of this new device. It can be an IP address or a USB serial number. If you've
selected a non-Android OS, this field is inactive.
<p>
Kodi Partition: For Android the default is /sdcard/ For other OSes, this field is inactive.
<p>
Media Center Package name: For Android the default is org.xbmc.kodi For other OSes, this field is inactive.
<p>
File Path: This the path to Kodi's data folder. For Android it defaults to /files/.kodi, on other OSes the path changes.
When you choose the OS, this field is filled in with a reasonable default.  You can also use the File Path button
to browse your local computer for the Kodi data area.
<p>
Pull Folder: This will allow you to set the file path for files copied from your Android device to be sent to.
<p>
USB checkbox <br>
IP address port
<p>
Both of these fields are  automatically filled in, but you can override them.
<p>

Media center radio buttons: <Android only> <br>
The choices are:<br>
Kodi<br>
SPMC<br>
Other<br>
<p>
Selecting Kodi or SPMC fills in the correct package name for the choice. Selecting
"Other" allows you to enter your own value for package name.
<p>
Android Partitions:  This listbox shows possible Kodi partitons on the
device. If your device is not connected only /sdcard/ will be listed.
If connected, you may see other partitons, such as /sdcard1/.
<p>
Double-clicking a partition in this box will change the value in the
Kodi Partition field.
